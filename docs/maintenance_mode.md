# Maintenance Mode

The application has a maintenance mode that can be enabled to prevent users from accessing the service. This is useful when deploying changes to the service that require downtime, or when the service is experiencing issues.

To active and deactivate maintenance mode, use the [GitHub Action](https://github.com/DFE-Digital/npq-registration/actions/workflows/maintenance.yml) defined by [.github/workflows/maintenance.yml](../.github/workflows/maintenance.yml)
