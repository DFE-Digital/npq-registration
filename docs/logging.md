# Monitoring, logging, and alerting

## Sentry
We use sentry.io for error tracking and performance monitoring. Ask a team member for access - this is done through digi-tools. 

## Logit
We use a logit.io ELK stack for log aggregation. This contains logs from all environments except review apps, and is useful for debugging failed deployments. Ask a team member for access - this is done through digi-tools.
