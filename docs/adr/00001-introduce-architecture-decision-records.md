# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2025-01-22

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We should record the architectural decisions made on this
project.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

## Consequences

When we make decisions that affect the architecture of our application, we include an ADR document explaining that decision for future developers.

For more information see Michael Nygard's article, linked above. For a lightweight ADR toolset, see Nat Pryce's [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools).
