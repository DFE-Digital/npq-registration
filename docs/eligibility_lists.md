## NPQ Eligibility Lists

Currently, NPQ uses five eligibility lists, which are processed in a [own initializer](.././config/initializers/pp50_institutions.rb).  
The `pp50` designation refers to the 50% of UK schools receiving the highest pupil premiumâ€” extra funding provided for students from financially disadvantaged families.

### File Location

The lists are stored in the [config/data/January2025](.././config/data/January2025) directory.

## Updating the Lists

New lists should follow the same format as the existing ones.  
If the format changes, updates must be made to the [initializer](.././config/initializers/pp50_institutions.rb).
