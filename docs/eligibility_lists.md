## NPQ Eligibility Lists

Currently, NPQ uses five eligibility lists, which are loaded from CSV files into the admin console, in the Workplaces tab.

The `PP50` designation refers to the 50% of UK schools receiving the highest pupil premium â€” extra funding provided for students from financially disadvantaged families.

## Eligibility Lists

The CSV files can have as many extra columns as you like, but they must have the required identifier column as specified below.
