## 25 March 2024

We're trialing new functionality in the API v3 sandbox which allows lead providers to add a
participantâ€™s schedule when accepting NPQ applications. We've added the optional schedule-identifier field on
the NPQ accept an application request body. This will prevent providers having to make manual changes if a
participant has been defaulted to the wrong schedule. We'd welcome feedback on this sandbox update before it
goes into production.
