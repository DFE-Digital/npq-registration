    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Who we are and why we process personal data</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      We are Teacher Continuing Professional Development (CPD), within the Department for Education (DfE).

      National professional qualifications (NPQs) are a national, voluntary suite of qualifications, designed to support the professional development of teachers and leaders. They are funded by CPD and delivered by teacher training providers and their delivery network.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      The term “teacher training providers” refers to all NPQ lead providers and their delivery networks.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Mentions of “us” and “we” means CPD and “you” means anyone using this service.
