<p class="govuk-body">
  Youâ€™re not eligible for scholarship funding for <%= localise_sentence_embedded_course_name(course) %> as your workplace is not in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/funding-for-national-professional-qualifications-npqs#scholarship-funding-for-autumn-2024">list of settings that are eligible for funding</a>.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  This means that you would need to pay for the course another way.
</p>
<p class="govuk-body">
  For example you could pay for the course fees yourself or ask your workplace or trust to:

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>cover the full cost of the NPQ</li>
    <li>share the cost of the NPQ with you</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<% # if the school is local authority/preschool or nursery, school or academy trust %>
<% if @form.funding_eligibility.possible_funding_for_non_pp50_and_fe? %>

  <p class="govuk-body">However, you may be eligible for scholarship funding for one of the following courses:</p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>leading primary mathematics</li>
    <li>headship</li>
    <li>special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO)</li>
    <li>early headship coaching offer</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="govuk-body">You can <a class="govuk-link" href="<%= registration_wizard_show_url(@wizard.previous_step_path) %>">go back and select one of these courses</a> instead to check if you're eligible.</p>
