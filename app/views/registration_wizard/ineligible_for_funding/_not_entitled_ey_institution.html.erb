<h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Funding</h1>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Youâ€™re not eligible for scholarship funding for <%= localise_sentence_embedded_course_name(course) %> because your workplace
  is not in the list of EY settings that are eligible for funding.
  <br>
  This means that you would need to pay for the course another way.
</p>
<p class="govuk-body">
  For example you could pay for the course fees yourself or ask your workplace or trust to:

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>cover the full cost of the NPQ</li>
  <li>share the cost of the NPQ with you</li>
</ul>
</p>
