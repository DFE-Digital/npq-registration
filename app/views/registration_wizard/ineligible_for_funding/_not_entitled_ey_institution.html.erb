<h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Funding</h1>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Youâ€™re not eligible for scholarship funding for <%= localise_sentence_embedded_course_name(course) %> as your workplace is not in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/funding-for-national-professional-qualifications-npqs#scholarship-funding-for-autumn-2024">list of EY settings that are eligible for funding</a>.
  <br>
  This means that you would need to pay for the course another way.
</p>
<p class="govuk-body">
  For example you could pay for the course fees yourself or ask your workplace or trust to:

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>cover the full cost of the NPQ</li>
    <li>share the cost of the NPQ with you</li>
  </ul>
</p>
