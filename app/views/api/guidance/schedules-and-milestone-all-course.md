# Schedules and milestone dates



DfE pays providers in line with agreed contractual schedules and training criteria. Providers are paid based on how much time they spend supporting participants. 

Providers must [submit declarations](https://register-national-professional-qualifications.education.gov.uk/api/guidance/how-to-guides/submit-view-and-void-declarations) ahead of milestone dates (deadlines) to ensure payments are made for a given milestone. 


## Concepts and definitions

| Concept              | Definition |
|----------------------|------------|
| **Schedule**         | The timeframe in which a participant starts a particular NPQ course, which determines milestone dates |
| **Milestone**        | Contractual retention periods during which providers must submit relevant declarations evidencing training delivery and participant retention |
| **Milestone dates**  | The deadline date a valid declaration can be made for a given milestone in order for DfE to be liable to make a payment the following month. Milestone dates are dependent on the participant’s schedule |
| **Milestone period** | The period of time between the milestone start date and deadline date |
| **Output payment**   | The sum of money paid by DfE to providers per valid declaration |
| **Payment date**     | The date DfE will make payment for valid declarations submitted by providers for a given milestone |
| **Milestone validation** | The API’s process to validate declarations submitted by providers for participants in standard training schedules |

## Schedules and dates

A default NPQ schedule can last from 12 to 22 months.  

<p class="govuk-body">For the 2025 cohort, a reduced number of schedules exist:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>NPQ Specialist Spring</li>
  <li>NPQ Leadership Spring</li>
  <li>NPQ EHCO March</li>
  <li>NPQ EHCO June</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">For the 2024 cohort, a reduced number of schedules exist:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>NPQ Specialist Autumn</li>
  <li>NPQ Leadership Autumn</li>
  <li>NPQ EHCO March</li>
  <li>NPQ EHCO June</li>
</ul>
For each of the milestones a provider is supporting a participant, DfE will pay the corresponding output payment according to valid declarations submitted. 

Declarations submitted for participants will be validated (accepted or rejected) against the milestone dates.  

Note, all participants will be registered by default to an autumn or spring schedule dependant when in the cohort they register in, as well as course type. EHCO has multiple schedules per year which fall outside of the usual spring and autumn schedules. 

Contact DfE contract managers via email for additional support or information.

## Validating declarations against milestones 

Declarations submitted for participants are subject to milestone validation. 
The API will perform milestone validation to reject a declaration if it is not submitted for the correct milestone. For example, the API will reject a retained-1 declaration if it is submitted during the started milestone period. 

If a declaration is submitted in a later milestone period (i.e. a started declaration submitted during the retained-1 milestone period), then it will be validated and paid at the next milestone payment.
