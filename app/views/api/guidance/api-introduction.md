# How the API works

The NPQ Application Programming Interface (API) lets your software system securely connect with ours to:

* collect new applications
* accept or reject applications
* get details of all applications and participants
* submit declarations and outcomes


## Key parts of the API 

<strong>Client:</strong> This is your system that sends or receives NPQ data.

<strong>API request:</strong> Your system sends a structured request to the NPQ API. For example, you might request a list of participants or submit a participant declaration.

<strong>Server:</strong> The NPQ API receives the request, processes it, and connects with the Department for Educationâ€™s database.

<strong>API response:</strong> The API sends back the requested data in a format your system can understand, such as JSON. For example, you might receive confirmation that a participant has been registered or see why an application was rejected.

## Why this matters

The NPQ API helps:

* reduce manual data entry
* improve accuracy and speed
* give providers real-time access to application and participant data

## Security and access

The API includes rules to:

* control who can access the data
* protect sensitive information
* ensure secure communication between systems
