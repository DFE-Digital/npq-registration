# Test environments

The test environments are used to test API integrations without affecting real data.

## Test environment links

We have a test environment for the API:

* API v3:
[https://npq-registration-sandbox-web.teacherservices.cloud/api/v3](https://npq-registration-sandbox-web.teacherservices.cloud/api/v3)

<div class="govuk-inset-text">
There are some custom API headers that can only be used in the test environment.
