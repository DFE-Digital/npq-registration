# Roadmap

## Why we‚Äôre sharing our roadmap publicly

This document explains what we‚Äôre working on to improve the digital services that facilitate the national professional qualification (NPQ) service.

It sets out what we‚Äôre working on now, what will come next, and what we might pursue later.

By sending this out publicly, we hope to:

- give direction to lead providers
- be transparent about what we‚Äôre working on and why
- gather more feedback about the work we‚Äôre aiming to do

Our objectives are centered around how we can make it easier for applicants to register for NPQs, and lead providers to process NPQ applicants.
