## What are the test environments

The test (sandbox) environments are used to test API integrations without affecting real data.

## Test environment links

We have test environments for each version of the API:

* API v1: 
[https://sb.manage-training-for-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/api/v1](https://sb.manage-training-for-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/api/v1)

* API v2:
[https://sb.manage-training-for-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/api/v2](https://sb.manage-training-for-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/api/v2)

* API v3: 
[https://sb.manage-training-for-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/api/v3](https://sb.manage-training-for-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/api/v3)
